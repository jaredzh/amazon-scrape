It worked just fine for the first month until I realized that a section of my yard was starting to die. A valve was stuck and wouldn’t open when it was timed to. So I had to start manually watering that area. Then a couple weeks later another valve stopped working and only worked sporadically. Wouldn’t buy again. It was really nice when it did work but I just can’t leave the lawn being watered up to chance. Don’t buy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Melnor-65038-AMZ-HydroLogic-Digital-Stainless/product-reviews/B07NF1F4NL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The interface is easy to use even though at first glance it looks overwhelming. I have had no issues with leaks or other parts breaking. Over the year that I have had this product I have only had one issue, after changing my setup the water pressure coming into the unit became too high and prevented the valves from opening. I reached out to the Melnor customer support and got a response the next day. The max PSI is 80 with a min of 20. Installing a pressure regulation valve was an easy cheap fix. I highly recommend this as a budget friendly timer with multiple zone control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Bought as a replacement we owned for 10+ yrs. Different brand, but it is working awesome! Love that I can set manual usage on any of the 4 zones whenever I want to. The part about setting the timer for 1 to 7 days is a bit confusing when you've already programed the specific days you want to run the system. Decided to chose 1 day, meaning we want to run the settings of the particular day on one day. Today it works just fine. Not sure if you even need to program the 1 to 7 day second or if it is an alternative to the specific days of the week you want the sprinkler zones to run. Set at one day is working perfectly for us with our pre-defined every other days of the week. Easy to read dials and easy to read indicators on the dials.

I ordered 65038-AMZ and was sent 73280-19G. They look identical, but apparently the one I was sent just sucks.

Even in testing my sprinkler set up, I've found this thing to be terribly unreliable. Hit manual, chose my zone, set a time... I could hear a click and the little facuet icon would show, but no water would flow. Other times it would work just fine. Once it sprayed water out of an outlet I wasn't even using before switching to the one I had selected a few seconds later.

A few days later - I can't get anything to turn on. I've taken out the batteries. Tried to reset things. NO WATER WILL FLOW. And yes, I checked to make sure the hose bib was on. :)

The fourth was a bonus and the price was fine.  The problem is that the unit does not reliably open the valves.  It gets to the time of execution, I can hear a click but not the loud click of the valve opening.  The time counts down but no water is flowing.  The biggest issue is that you don't realize the valves are not opening until whatever you were watering dies.  It is also very consistent, once a valve stops opening that same valve will never open again using the timer.  I returned the first unit because channel 3 would not open but on the replacement unit channels 2 and 3 do not open.

Most confusing of all is that when I set it to manually open they work fine but when the timer tries to execute the valves do not open.  It is very unreliable.  I ended up going back to my 2 year old Rain Bird which only has 2 channels.

Finally, the newer model is not new.  65038 is just the previous model with 5 useless washers included.  In fact the unit has the old model number on the back but the package shows the new number.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

However, the timer seems to be programmed to skip a watering cycle based upon a wet sensor for ONLY Zone 1.  Water continues to flow for the other three zones despite how wet the sensor gets.  This fact is not addressed in any of the Melnor advertising or instruction manuals for either the timer or the sensor.  Customer support at Melnor also was not aware of this.  Perhaps there might be a way to program the timer to respond to signals from the sensor to control flow to Zones, 2, 3 and 4, but that remains a mystery.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""
